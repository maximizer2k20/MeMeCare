# MeMeCare
My children love the word MeMe, so I'm using it to create a self care app for adults of all kinds who have to heal from unresolved past and become their best and strongest versions. This is a Github version for humans to constantly reinvent themselves and prove what they're capable of doing when they pripritize MeMeCare. 

MeMeCare is a self-care app (you may also call is a welf(C)are app) focused on emotional healing and personal growth could include features like:

Journaling & Reflection
  - Guided prompts for self-reflection

Mindfulness & Meditation
  - Breathing exercises, guided meditations, and relaxation techniques

Therapeutic Activities
  - Art therapy
  - Music therapy
  - Gratitude practices

Emotional Check-ins
  - Mood tracking and suggestions based on emotional state

Personalized Growth Plans

Community Support
  - Anonymized forums or group support

AI-powered Coaching
  - Personalized recommendations based on input.
